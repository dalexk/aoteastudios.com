## What we do 

If you’re a business analyst, we can help you be more effective in your job. That’s our goal.

Most people learn faster & easier with the help of visual information, and retain more afterwards. Plus, a good diagram serves as great reference material later. That’s why you can expect to see a lot of diagrams and other visual aids in our products.

We believe that business analysts are crucial to business success, and by helping business analysts we help businesses be more successful.

We have created a range of products to help BAs learn quickly and be more productive. We also publish free articles and diagrams on business analysis, enterprise architecture and project management related topics on our blog. Our diagrams have been downloaded by thousands of people and are used by various companies around the world.

Our change management diagram is included in the book called Project Management for Healthcare by David Shirley ([http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Healthcare-ESI-International/dp/143981953X/](http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Healthcare-ESI-International/dp/143981953X/), p. 110). It's also included in UK PMO software Particulus and used in Project Agency (UK) training courses.

We are based in Wellington, the windy capital of New Zealand.
